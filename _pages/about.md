In 2014 I received a Ph.D. degree from the [University of Bergen](http://www.uib.no/). The main direction of my research was the development and analysis of symmetric cryptographic primitives. A part of the research has been devoted to the development of the Ukrainian standards of block cipher and hash function ([DSTU 7624:2014](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/650.pdf) and [DSTU 7564:2014](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/885.pdf)).

After graduating, I got a technical test analyst position in [EVRY](https://www.evry.com/). The main responsibilities are perform full cycle non-functional tests and aid [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) audits mainly in Requirement 11.1-11.3. Moreover, I contribute to methodologies, processes and corporate policies covering non-functional testing.

Moreover, I am also interested in all aspects of information security, including modern trends in the design of next generation symmetric cryptoprimitives, cloud computations and security, secure protocols, and computer network security.
