I graduated from [Kharkov National University of Radio Electronics](http://nure.ua/en/) (Ukraine), Department of Information Technology Security, in 2010. Started as a research fellow at the Department of Informatics, [University of Bergen](http://www.uib.no/) (Norway), in 2011. As a PhD student at the UoB I did my studies on the topic of symmetric primitives. My main interests were nonlinear components (substitutions) for modern symmetric algorithms including block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions. Moreover, I was also interested in diverse aspects of information security such as modern trends in designing of the next generation symmetric ciphers, cloud computations and security, secure protocols, computer network security and security analysis of complex systems. 

In 2014 I got the degree of Candidate of Engineering Sciences in Information Security in Ukraine. Later this year I was awarded with the Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Bergen for ["Methods and Tools for Analysis of Symmetric Cryptographic Primitives"]({% post_url /theses/2014/2014-12-01-Methods-and-Tools-for-Analysis-of-Symmetric-Cryptographic-Primitives-thesis %}).

Currently I hold the position of technical test analyst with a focus on non-functional testing in [EVRY](https://www.evry.com). The main responsibilities are designing and performing security and penetration tests of web applications, networks, and systems in [Financial Services](https://www.evry.com/services/industry/financial-services/).
