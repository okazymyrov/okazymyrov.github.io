In 2014, I received a Ph.D. from the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/), where my research focused on the development and analysis of symmetric cryptographic primitives. A significant part of this work contributed to the Ukrainian national standards for block cipher and hash function ([DSTU 7624:2014](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/650.pdf) and [DSTU 7564:2014](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/885.pdf)).

Over the past 15 years, my information security career has evolved from academia to hands-on security engineering and further into management and CISO roles. This breadth of experience enables me to help organisations achieve both strategic and tactical security objectives, regardless of complexity. My qualifications are backed by industry-recognised certifications including [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp), Red Team Operator, and a portfolio of Microsoft credentials (AZ-900, AZ-500, AZ-700, SC-900, SC-200, SC-300, and SC-400).

My combined practical and managerial expertise bridges the gap between business stakeholders and subject-matter experts. I adapt quickly to new challenges and deliver cost-effective solutions. I believe that a positive work environment with space for creativity is an essential prerequisite for achieving desired goals. Colleagues describe me as result-oriented, organised, and helpful.
