              The development of modern cryptography is associated with the emergence of computing machines. Since specialized equipment for protection of sensitive information was initially implemented only in hardware, stream ciphers were widespread. Later, other areas of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography were established with the invention of general-purpose processors. In particular, such symmetric cryptographic primitives as block ciphers, message authentication codes (MACs), authenticated ciphers and others began to develop rapidly. Today various cryptographic algorithms are commonly used in everyday life to protect private data.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0;">
              Design and analysis of advanced symmetric cryptographic primitives require a lot of time and resources. This is related to many factors, mainly to the cryptanalysis of prospective encryption algorithms under development. Every year new and modified attacks are published, leading to a rapid increase in the quantity of requirements and criteria imposed on cryptoprimitives.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0;">
              Most of this thesis is devoted to analysis and improvement of cryptographic attacks and corresponding criteria for basic components. Almost all modern cryptoprimitives use nonlinear mappings for protection against advanced attacks. In connection with that a new method was proposed for the generation of random substitutions (S-boxes) with extreme cryptographic indicators that can be used in the next-generation ciphers to provide high and ultra-high security levels. In addition, several criteria imposed on S-boxes used in block ciphers were analyzed and their significance for block ciphers was proven. It is worth mentioning a practical method of testing two vectorial Boolean functions and a universal tool for checking properties of arbitrary binary nonlinear components presented in papers gathered in this thesis.

              Another part of the thesis is dedicated to the cryptanalysis of hash functions as well as block and stream ciphers. To be more precise, an algebraic attack based on a binary decision diagram (BDD) was performed on the reduced Data Encryption Standard (DES), a scaled-down version of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and extended affine (EA) equivalence problem. Moreover, an algebraic approach was used to reconstruct an initial representation of the current Russian hash standard GOST 34.11-2012. Finally, a backward states tree method has been used to analyze stream ciphers based on the combination principle of linear and nonlinear feedback registers.

          <h3>Methods and Tools to Generate Nonlinear Substitution Boxes for Symmetric Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>
          <h4>

              New methods to generate nonlinear substitutions with optimal properties that can be used in advanced symmetric cryptographic primitives are proposed in the thesis. These methods combine the heuristic approach and the theory of vectorial Boolean functions.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0;">
              Based on the algebraic cryptanalysis of block ciphers submitted to the Ukrainian competition, the extended criterion of algebraic immunity and the criterion for multiple substitutions belonging to different equivalence classes were taken into account in the generation procedures.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0;">
              The best among the proposed methods allows to increase the nonlinearity from 96 to 104 while the algebraic immunity and the &delta;-uniformity remain unchanged. The use of such substitutions in the block cipher «Kalyna», which was noted in the Ukrainian competition for selection of a prospective encryption algorithm, provides a high level of resistance against cryptographic attacks.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0;">
              The efficiency of the new methods was confirmed by practical implementations for a cluster system. Using the developed programs, several specific substitutions for both existing and prospective symmetric cryptographic algorithms were proposed.
