## Abstract

Arguments to support the conjecture that the average probability of maximum linear approximation and differentials tables of S-boxes do not define the cryptographic properties of the whole cipher are given. The indicators are defined as the average values of the maximum total characteristics of random permutations and can be calculated according to formulas.
