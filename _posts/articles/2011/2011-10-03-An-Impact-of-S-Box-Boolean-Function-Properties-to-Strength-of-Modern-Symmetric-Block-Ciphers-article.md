## Abstract

S-boxes are among the most important parts in modern symmetric ciphers. Generation of substitutions with good cryptographic properties is one of the meaningful components in the new ciphers’ design. Boolean function properties of several modern block ciphers’ S-boxes are analyzed. An overview of existing requirements to S-box generation is given, and the most significant for the strength of symmetric block ciphers are chosen.
