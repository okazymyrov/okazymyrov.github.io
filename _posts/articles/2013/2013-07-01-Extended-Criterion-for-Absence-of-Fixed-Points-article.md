## Abstract

One of the criteria for substitutions used in block ciphers is the absence of fixed points. In this paper we show that this criterion must be extended taking into consideration a mixing key function. In practice, we give description of AES when fixed points are reached. Additionally, it is shown that modulo addition has more advantages than XOR operation.
