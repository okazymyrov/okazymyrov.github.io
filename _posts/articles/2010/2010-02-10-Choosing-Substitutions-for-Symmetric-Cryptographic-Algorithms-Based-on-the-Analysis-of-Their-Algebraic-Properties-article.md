## Abstract

An approach for protection symmetric cryptographic primitives against algebraic cryptanalysis is considered in the article. A proof of the minimal order of the system of equations, which describe arbitrary S-box with n-bit input and m-bit output, is given. There are proposed several indicators for S-boxes comparison based on the analysis of block ciphers. Nonlinear components of modern ciphers including AES/Rijndael, Camellia, Kalyna and Labyrinth are compared according to the proposed criterion.
