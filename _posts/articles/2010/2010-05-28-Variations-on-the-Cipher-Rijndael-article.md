## Abstract

We consider an approach to analyze cryptographic properties of block ciphers which is based on the scale-down algorithms. Complexities of differential attacks for several modifications of SPN ciphers with 16-bit input are estimated by using this approach. It is shown that there exist solutions, which was proposed by Howard Heys, that exceed indicators of the Rijndael.
