## Abstract

The Kupyna hash function was approved as the new Ukrainian standard DSTU~7564:2014 in 2015. Main requirements for it were both high security level and good performance of software implementation on general-purpose 64-bit CPUs. The new hash function uses Davies-Meyer compression function based on Even-Mansour cipher construction. Kupyna is built on the transformations of the Kalyna block cipher (Ukrainian standard DSTU 7624:2014). In this paper we present the adapted English translated specification of the Kupyna hash function as it is described in the national standard of Ukraine.
