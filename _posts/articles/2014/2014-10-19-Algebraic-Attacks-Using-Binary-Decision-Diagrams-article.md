## Abstract

Algebraic attacks have been developed against symmetric primitives during the last decade. In this paper we represent equation systems using binary decision diagrams, and explain techniques for solving them.  Next, we do experiments with systems describing reduced versions of DES and AES, as well as systems for the problem of determining EA-equivalence. We compare our results against Gr&ouml;bner basis and CryptoMiniSat.
