## Abstract

Many new ciphers are being introduced every year. Each well-educated researcher with a degree in computer science can create a good cryptoprimitive, which will be unbreakable awhile. The main blocks of modern ciphers are nonlinear components also known as substitutions. The toolbox (library) for decreasing time of analyzing such components is given in this paper. It can be used for investigation cryptographic properties of arbitrary nonlinear binary mappings used in symmetric primitives.
