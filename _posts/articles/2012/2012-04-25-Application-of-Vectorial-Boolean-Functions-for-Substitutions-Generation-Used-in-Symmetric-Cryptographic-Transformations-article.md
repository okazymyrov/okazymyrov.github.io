## Abstract

The descriptions of the vectorial Boolean functions as well as criteria for substitutions and a new method for S-box generation for the cipher GOST 28147-89 with optimal computational complexity are given. The method provides substitutions that belong to different affine classes, with nonlinearity 4, minimum degree 3, 4-uniform and without fixed points.
