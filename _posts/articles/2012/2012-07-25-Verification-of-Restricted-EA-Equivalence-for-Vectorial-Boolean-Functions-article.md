## Abstract

We present algorithms for solving the restricted extended affine equivalence (REA-equivalence) problem for any \\( m \\)-dimensional vectorial Boolean function in \\( n \\) variables. The best of them has complexity \\( O(2^{2n+1}) \\) for REA-equivalence \\( F(x) = M\_1 \cdot G\(x \oplus V\_2\) \oplus M\_3 \cdot x \oplus V\_1 \\). The algorithms are compared with previous effective algorithms for solving the linear and the affine equivalence problem for permutations by Biryukov et. al.
