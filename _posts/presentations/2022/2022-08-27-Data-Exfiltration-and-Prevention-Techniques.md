## Abstract

Data exfiltration is one of the most critical threats organizations face today, yet it remains underestimated in many security programs. This talk explores the MITRE ATT&CK exfiltration techniques, covering the methods adversaries use to steal data from compromised environments - from DNS tunneling and encrypted channels to exfiltration over alternative protocols and physical media. For each technique, corresponding prevention and detection strategies are discussed, providing practical guidance on how to build layered defenses against data loss. The presentation aims to raise awareness on the breadth of exfiltration vectors and equip security teams with actionable countermeasures.
