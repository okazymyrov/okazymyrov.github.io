## Abstract

Despite of technical vulnerabilities are managed internally or through a partner, the same types of challenges arise. Many organizations believe that after buying a vulnerability management as a service (VMaaS) the partner will mitigate vulnerabilities. In fact, the reality shows that choosing and establishing a technical solution is the first small step in the vulnerability management program. Experience-based pitfalls associated with vulnerability management will be discussed in this talk.
