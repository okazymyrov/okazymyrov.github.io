## Abstract

Offensive security is a proactive approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them. This talk covers the core disciplines of offensive security — including penetration testing, red teaming, and vulnerability assessments — and how they complement defensive measures within an enterprise security program. Drawing on practical experience at Storebrand, the presentation discusses methodologies, tooling, engagement scoping, and how offensive findings translate into actionable improvements for the organization's overall security posture.
