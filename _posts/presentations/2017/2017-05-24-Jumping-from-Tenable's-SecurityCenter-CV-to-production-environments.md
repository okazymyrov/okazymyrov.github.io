## Abstract

This talk will cover passive (extracting information on assets, users, passwords, private keys, etc.) and active (encrypted credentials) information gathering on a rooted server with installed Tenable's SecurityCenter. Moreover, a method for lateral movement from DMZ to production environments using features of Nessus scanning will be demonstrated. It will help red teams to penetrate deeper into internal networks, especially into those containing highly valuable information, like cardholder data environments. From the blue team perspective, the demonstrated techniques will help better understand the risk of vulnerability scanners placed unattended in DMZ zones.
