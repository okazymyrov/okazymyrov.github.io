## Abstract

UnITy is an information security program designed to unify and structure security efforts across an organization. This talk presents the program's approach to implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), covering how its five core functions — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — are translated into practical activities and measurable outcomes. The presentation discusses the challenges of aligning security initiatives with business objectives in the maritime industry, establishing governance, and building a security culture that scales with organizational growth.
