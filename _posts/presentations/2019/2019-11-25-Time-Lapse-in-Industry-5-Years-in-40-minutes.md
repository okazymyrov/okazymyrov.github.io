## Abstract

Transitioning from academia to industry brings a unique perspective on how information security evolves in practice. This talk compresses five years of experience into a 40-minute journey, covering the key milestones of building and maturing an information security program - from initial assessments and framework adoption (NIST CSF) to establishing vulnerability management, penetration testing, and security governance. Lessons learned, common pitfalls, and practical advice for those considering a similar path are shared throughout the presentation.
