## Abstract

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-based endpoint management solutions such as Microsoft Intune and similar platforms, they gain significant operational efficiency - but often at the cost of introducing new security risks. This presentation examines the trade-offs between ease of management and security posture when relying on cloud-based endpoint management. Through real-world examples and offensive research, we uncover common misconfigurations, overly permissive policies, and architectural weaknesses that attackers can exploit. The talk provides actionable recommendations for security teams to harden their cloud endpoint management deployments without sacrificing the operational benefits.
