## Abstract

This talk walks through a realistic offensive kill chain demonstrating how an attacker could piece together seemingly innocuous data points to reveal a client's financial status within a financial services organization. Starting from initial reconnaissance and progressing through exploitation, lateral movement, and data correlation, the presentation illustrates how chained vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can lead to the exposure of sensitive financial information. The session highlights practical lessons for defenders on breaking the kill chain at each stage and strengthening controls around financial data protection.
